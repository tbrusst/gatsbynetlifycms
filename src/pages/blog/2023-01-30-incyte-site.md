Incyte is a large pharmaceutical company based in Wilmington, Delaware. During my time at Defy, we worked with Incyte to design them a brand new website from scratch. Alongside our team at Defy, we collaborated with a content strategy agency as well as a development agency. Incyte worked closely with the content strategy team to come up with a detailed content layout and manuscript. This broke down each page into its intended components as well as the specific copy and content that would be present within said components. Our role in this process began from there onwards.

#### Objective
Defy’s objective in this project was to design out all of the unique pages (~30 in total) making sure they are easy to use as well as reflecting updated brand aesthetics that our team recently developed for Incyte. Incyte’s previous site did not feel very modern and the brand had evolved a lot since its creation. It was also not as user friendly as it could have been nor did it communicate all that Incyte had been up to and was currently working on. I was tasked to be the lead designer from the Defy side. I primarily built out all the website designs we handed off to the development team.

#### Wireframing
This process begins with wireframing. Once we had received the manuscript and site map we were able to understand what all the unique pages were and what they would specifically need to contain.

Though the screenshots displayed here are of high fidelity finished wireframes, this process began with simple gray boxes that were put through several rounds of feedback and testing before we were able to proceed with enhancing them to this level. Once the basic flow and user experience was approved by Incyte at a low fidelity, we were able to bring in all of the brand elements to make the site feel as intimately Incyte as possible.

I built out all of the individual page templates at three different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop). All of this was done in Sketch using bootstrap grids as requested by the developers.

#### Development
With a site of this scale dev handoff and QA are incredibly time consuming processes but are of even greater importance. I built the screens with as many shared components as possible to minimize lift for the developers as well as creating stronger visual unity throughout the site. We assisted with any assets or motion design guidance the dev team needed. Our team created detailed PDFs and documentation explaining the functions of the designs and shared notes constantly across teams to make the build go as smoothly as possible. After a few weeks of development and QA the new Incyte site is live and running.
