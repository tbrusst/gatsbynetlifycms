### Context

Our team at Defy was asked to help update Brinker Capital Investments's look and feel as apart of a larger project to rebrand their parent company, Orion. I was tasked to focus specifically on designing Brinker's new direction while the rest of the team worked on Orion. The goal was to ensure that Brinker, despite being a sub-brand, had a strong enough aesthetic that it could live on its own.

### Execution

Although I was the sole designer for Brinker, I was working as collaboratively as possible with my fellow designers, creatives, and team members in general. I would share work with them constantly in preparation for presentations to the client to receive necessary feedback from the Orion team. The suggestions and feedback I received was vital in developing Brinker's brand system. 

Brinker's clients need to feel like their investments are in good hands. Therefore the brand itself was designed to feel sophisticated and trustworthy. Muted colors, a strong mix of serif and sans-serif, as well as strong lines and shapes all contributed to this aesthetic.

### Results

We created several different proofs of concepts that enlisted the colors, fonts, and design elements we reimagined for Brinker.The client ended up wanting to go in a different direction for Brinker, but we were very proud of the system we had created as a team.
