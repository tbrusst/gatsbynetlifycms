Orion is a wealth technology company that provides innovative solutions to wealth advisory firms. The platform had been seeing such great results that they decided to obtain a long standing client and existing wealth advisory firm called Brinker Capital Investments. My team at Defy was brought on by Orion to redesign their brand as well as their acquired sub-brand in Brinker. While the rest of my team focused on Orion, I was tasked as the sole designer for Brinker's redesign. The goal was to ensure that Brinker, despite being a sub-brand, had a strong enough aesthetic that it could live on its own while still feeling visually connected to Orion.

### Execution

I worked as collaboratively as possible with my fellow designers, creatives, and team members. I would share work with them in preparation for presentations to make sure we were hitting goals and deadlines as accurately as possible. It was increasingly important to work closely with the team at large in order to keep the two brands in sync throughout the design process. The suggestions and feedback I received were vital in developing Brinker's brand system.

Brinker's clients need to feel like their investments are in good hands. Therefore the brand itself was designed to feel sophisticated and trustworthy. Muted colors, a classic serif, a solid sans-serif, and strong shapes all contributed to this aesthetic.

### Results

We created several different proofs of concepts that enlisted the colors, fonts, and design elements we reimagined for Brinker. By the time we had finished we had built out digital display ads, pamphlets, presentation templates, document templates, and the list goes on. The client decided to scrap the project for both Brinker and Orion, but we were very proud of the system we had created as a team.
