The Defy team's website previously utilized a confusing dual-column layout that was intriguing to fellow designers but fell flat in keeping existing and potential clients engaged. It was not getting the traction an agency site should be and therefore needed a full redesign. As a designer at Defy with heavy web experience, I was tasked with this project. The goal was to create new designs for the Defy agency site that would make sense to users, provide clients with the information they need, and reflect Defy's evolving brand aesthetic.

### User Experience Design

The Defy site was leaving users confused on where to find information and how to get in contact with the team. The navigation was not organized well so users could not find the pages they needed efficiently. We implemented a new navigation system that made it much simpler to move about the large site. There is now a primary navigation bar that can take users to the most important and frequently requested pages such as home, about, contact, etc. The sub navigation is only visible via a hamburger icon and can guide users to any of the other pages that exist on the site. We also moved the site to a more traditional layout as opposed to the 2-column layout that previously existed in which there were 2 separate grids that would scroll independent of each other. These are just a few examples of the user experience improvements we made to the site throughout the redesign.

### Brand Refresh

The Defy aesthetic has evolved quite a bit in recent years and the previous site did not reflect that evolution as accurately as it could have. The redesign was an excellent opportunity to assess where new design elements could be implemented to help the site feel more in line with the current brand direction. Vibrant gradients, ribbons of sliding text, updated imagery, strong shapes, interesting compositions were all utilized to emphasize this new direction and was ultimately successful in its mission.

### Results

After finishing the new designs we collaborated with a development team and made sure they had all they needed to build the site. Once the site had been completed and published we began to run ad and email campaigns to get traction and feedback. Our response and engagement numbers have never been higher. Users are finally finding it easy to learn what we do and how to contact us.
